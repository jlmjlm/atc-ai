Interesting seeds:
	1376278304 plane begins at NE corner, but not in the exit (1 interior
			to it).  Later two other planes begins at exit 3,
			not in the exit but 1 in from it

	1376278778 plane begins *in* the exit (is this a jets vs. props thing?
			-- looking like it -- nope)

	1376279911 has a lot cf planes at the start
