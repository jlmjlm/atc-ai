A errexit or something to fix up the terminal then emit the error message.
Trigger updates when it's been a while since the last read from atc,

print out (to the log) all planes' courses if get stuck in a loop.
option to use time() for the random seed; option to not pass 'atc' a seed
store revision ID (hash) in the object?
Notice when we get a game over and "Press space".
Figure out exits' directions by letting planes glide if safe.
Handle rogue planes which were shrouded by other planes
	- figure out bearing based on neighboring shadowed squares from 
			last turn and directions which lead directly
			from an exit
	- turn plane in a direction compatible with all poss. bearings
 	- guess based on proximity of exits
Recalculate other planes' courses if they're interfering with
	a new plane's.
Landing consumes the plane.  See if you can take off from the airport
	on that turn too.  (If a prop, taking off at even/odd turn matters.
	Props move only on even turns.)  It seems to work just fine.
Watch memory usage over a long run to check for leaks.
'make dist'
A different "err log" for bugs.

Interesting seeds:
	1376278304 plane begins at NE corner, but not in the exit (1 interior
			to it).  Later two other planes begins at exit 3,
			not in the exit but 1 in from it

	1376278778 plane begins *in* the exit (is this a jets vs. props thing?
			-- looking like it -- nope)

	1376279911 has a lot cf planes at the start

	1376508107 something goes wrong with the new plane 'D' at the UL
		corner 
	1376515486 similar
	1376535757 On turn 23 produces a plane at (0, 29, 7)
		[upper right corner].  Also, something weird with plane 'C'
		which appears at the North exit on time 34 or so.
		It 'illegally left the flight arena' on its first move.
		Huh?
